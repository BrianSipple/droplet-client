# Trumps

Classes that "always win".

The properties defined in these classes each make use of the CSS  [`!important` rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#The_!important_exception). They are to be used with discretion -- and while `!important` is generally ill-advised within a broader set of style rules due to the risk of side-effects, isolating its use to explicit classes provides a way to offer the mechanism explicitly -- transparently and traceably (though again, with caution).

# The Source

This is where _Savvy's_ CSS is written in a syntax that utilizes features of upcoming specifications.
It's then sent off to [Gulp](../gulp/), where it's transformed to current-spec CSS by PostCSS and packaged for [distribution](../dist/)

Documentation for each section is located within its local README.

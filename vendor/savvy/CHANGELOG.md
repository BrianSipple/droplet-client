0.11.0 / 2016-04-27

* z-indexing "nuclear option" helpers.
* `.g-caps` helper for uppercasing text.

* `.g-stroke-currentColor` and `.g-fill-currentColor`


0.10.4 / 2016-03-20
==================
* `.g-list-reset` now handles setting `margin` to `auto`.

0.10.3 / 2016-03-17
==================
* Overflow utilities for `auto` and fixes to `o-grid-cell` helper nesting.

0.10.2 / 2016-03-17

0.10.1 / 2016-03-17
==================
* N/A (NPM publishing errors -- we moved straight to 0.10.3)

0.10.0 / 2016-03-17
==================
 * `currentColor` garnishes... because `currentColor` is amazing.

 * Breaking Changes
    * .g-label has been removed
    * .g-ellipsized-line is now g-truncate
    * g-h1 and co have been removed
    * `g-link—reset` is now `.g-link-reset` both because it’s not quite a modifier on an existing rule, and so it can be syntactically similar to `.g-list-reset`
    * `.u-min-width-at-break--[modifier]` is now `.u-min-width-at-breakpoint--[modifier]`, and has a much more well-defined behavior.    

* More Typography enhancements
    * garnishes for underline and strikethrough
    * `.g-clip` garnish for clipping overflowed text
    * Utilities for word-wrapping

* content justification utilities

* Initial implementation of additional, more-fine-grained, flex-grid-cell utilities.

* Intent to deprecated `.u-list-reset`.
    * Please use `.g-list-reset`, as the rule has now been classified as a garnish

* Fine-grained utility for `g-list-style-none`

* `o-divider` object for horizontal and vertical dividers

* Sizing utilities for height on the tenths

0.9.1 / 2016-03-05
==================
 * Added overflow:hidden to `.g-ellipsized-line` so it actual works

0.9.0 / 2016-03-05
==================
 * c-button no longer exists; the experiment is over. Savvy is concerned with enabling
 component composition as opposed to components themselves, and right now, there's no
 real intent to try and ship components with locked-in styles.

0.8.5 / 2016-03-05
==================
 * c-button no longer sets `flex-direction: column` by default

0.8.4 / 2016-03-04

now scales up again at the `xxLarge` breakpoint, instead of `xLarge`.

0.7.3 / 2016-02-25
==================
 * Line height support for `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>` tags.

0.7.1 / 2016-02-25
==================

0.7.0 / 2016-02-24
==================
 * Main Border utilities now only use a single-dash in the last portion of the rule. For example `g-border--s2` is now `g-border-s2`.
 * Font size utilities for setting font locally according to the root

0.6.0 / 2016-02-17
==================

  * Animation is now a first-class concern with an `a` prefix.

  * Border style/width combination utilities.
  * Inherited and "fitted" width utilities.
  * `.o-list--flat` has been slated for deprecation. `.o-list--reset` is now the recommended selector name for this behavior.

0.3.0 / 2016-01-12
==================

  * version 2 of responsive flex gridding is in place
  * box-sizing utilities added
